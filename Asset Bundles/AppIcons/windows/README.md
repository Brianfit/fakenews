# Fake News: A Drinking Game

You can download the finished app from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dopeykleptocrat.onionapp&hl=en) or the [Apple app Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fake-news-a-drinking-game/id1429812735?mt=8)


Updated every day, this great party game serves up a random selection of actual, but hard to believe, headlines and satirical ones. Players guess if the headline is real or if it's fake. Get it wrong? You drink. OK, you don't have to drink. It's fun to play  with or without alcohol. And with or without friends. 

But there's comfort in both those things when the line between what's absurd and what's normal is so blurry it's practically no line at all. 

The headlines are sourced from Reddit: one subreddit called "The Onion" which simply reproduces headlines from the satirical news site, and another subreddit called "Not The Onion" which serves up headlines so weird or farcical that they seem fake. 

There's an educational value here as well: working the muscles that help us distinguish between truth and falsehood is a good thing for stuff like democracy and human interaction and the future of the species. 

But most of all, it's good fun to be absolutely sure something is false only to find out it's true, or vice versa. And the laugh it generates is a sure sign that something important, that flicker of uncertainty that makes us doubt our own beliefs, is alive and well. And THAT little flicker of uncertainty is the only way humanity progresses. 

Enjoy the fun of being fallible, and human.

## Getting Started

This is a Cordova project. The core code, located in the www directory is plain old html and javascript. You can run it in a browser. With Cordova you can compile versions for IOS, Android, OS X, Windows Phone, and increasingly minor mobile platforms from there. This build includes IOS and Android versions only.  

### Prerequisites

Cordova
Xcode
Android Studio


### Installing

You'll want to install the Cordova CLI (Command Line Interface) according to the [instructions here](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/cli/)

In the example, you create an app called hello and a directory called com.example.hello containing your project. You'll replace those with your own app name and directory of course.  Once you've created your project:

1. Replace the contents of the www directory with the contents of the www directory from this repository. 
2. Install the following plugins: Cordova Plugin Whitelist; admob; connectivity-monitor; libgoogleadmobads; plugin-device
3. Add the ios and android platforms. Done
